GyroApp is a mobile application developed for capturing and storing gyroscope data on Android devices. It leverages the Android Sensor API to monitor gyroscope sensor readings and persists the data using Room, a local SQLite database.

Features
Gyroscope Data Capture: The app continuously captures gyroscope sensor data, including X, Y, and Z-axis values, providing insights into device orientation and movement.

Real-time Display: View real-time gyroscope sensor readings on the user interface, allowing users to observe changes as they occur.

Technologies Used
Kotlin: The app is written in Kotlin, a modern programming language for Android development.

Room Database: Room is employed for local data storage, ensuring efficient and persistent gyroscope data management.

Coroutines: Leveraging Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous and responsive data processing.

Android Architecture Components: GyroApp leverages various Android Architecture Components, including ViewModel and LiveData, for robust and lifecycle-aware data management.

Sensor API: The Android Sensor API is used for accessing device sensor data, providing insights into gyroscope readings and other sensor information.

RecyclerView: GyroApp utilizes RecyclerView to efficiently display and manage lists of gyroscope data in the user interface.

Material Design Components: The app follows the principles of Material Design, incorporating Material Design Components for a cohesive and visually appealing user experience.


Getting Started
To run the GyroApp project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/infernotlc/Life-Signal.git
Open the project in Android Studio.
